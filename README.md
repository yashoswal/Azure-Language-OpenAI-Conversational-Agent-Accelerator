# Azure Language OpenAI Conversational Agent Accelerator

### Overview
This solution accelerator provides users with a code-first example on how to augment an existing `RAG` solution with Azure AI Language functionality. It leverages Conversational Language Understanding (`CLU`) and Custom Question Answering (`CQA`) to dynamically improve a `RAG` chat experience. 

**Harness the capabilities of Azure AI Language and Azure OpenAI together.**

Below is an image of the solution accelerator:

### Use Case / Scenario
A typical `RAG` solution allows users to chat with an AI assistant and obtained grounded responses. Chat messages are sent directly to AOAI, where a specified model (e.g. GPT-4o) processes each message and creates a response.
This is beneficial when customers have their own grounding data (e.g. product manuals, company information for Q/A). They would set up an Azure AI Search index to query their grounding data, and preprocess user chat messages by fetching relevant grounding data and passing it to the AOAI model downstream.
Because the model now "knows" the grounding data to base its response around, user chats are met with contextual responses, improving the chat experience.

However, issues with `RAG` solutions (DSATs, or dissatisfactory examples) are hard to address. It is hard to debug or update grounding data to fix inaccurate "grounded" responses. Further, this process can be timely and expensive.

Azure AI Language can help address these issues and expand the functionality of existing `RAG` chat solutions. Azure AI Language already offers two services: Conversational Language Understanding (`CLU`) and Custom Question Answering (`CQA`).
`CLU` analyzes user inputs to extract intents and entities. `CQA` uses pre-defined question-answer pairs or a pre-configured knowledgebase to answer user questions.

### Solution Architecture
![image](./docs/images/architecture.png)

This project includes a `UnifiedConversationOrchestrator` class that unifies both `CLU` and `CQA` functionality. Using a variety of different routing strategies, this orchestrator can intelligently route user input to a `CLU` or `CQA` model.
There is also fallback functionality when any of the following occurs: neither runtime is called, API call failed, confidence threshold not met, `CLU` did not recognize an intent, `CQA` failed to answer the question.
This fallback functionality can be configured to be any function. In this user-story, fallback will be the original `RAG` solution. The orchestrator object takes a string message as input, and outputs a dictionary object containing information regarding what runtime was called, relevant outputs, was fallback called, etc.

When combined with an existing `RAG` solution, adding a `UnifiedConversationOrchestrator` can help in the following ways:
- manual overrides of DSAT examples using `CQA`.
- extended chat functionality based on recognized intents/entities using `CLU`.
- consistent fallback to original chat functionality with `RAG`.
Further, users can provide their own business logic to call based on `CLU` results (e.g. with an `OrderStatus` intent and `OrderId` entity, user can include business logic to query a database to check the order status).

The container app demo included with this project showcases the following chat experience:
- user inputs chat dialog.
- AOAI node preprocesses by breaking input into separate utterances.
- Orchestrator routes each utterance to either `CLU`, `CQA`, or fallback `RAG`.
- If `CLU` was called, call extended business logic based on intent/entities.
- Agent summarizes response (what business action was performed, provide answer to question, provide grounded response).

**Consider the following real-world example:**
A customer, Contoso Outdoors, has an existing `RAG` chat solution using AOAI. Their grounding data is composed of product manuals of the outdoor gear they sell.
Because of this, users can easily ask the AI chat questions regarding Contoso Outdoors products (e.g. What tents do you sell?) and obtain grounded, contextual, and accurate responses.

However, if a user asks questions about the company's return policy, the `RAG` chat will not be able to respond accurately, as the grounding data does not contain any information regarding a return policy.
It can be expensive and time consuming to update the grounding data to address this. Further, if a user asks a question about their online order status, even with updates of grounding data, `RAG` is not able to respond effectively here, as information is dynamic.

Incorporating `CLU`/`CQA` using a `UnifiedConversationOrchestrator` solves these problems. Contoso Outdoors would set up a `CQA`   model that can answer extended questions (e.g. their return policy), and set up a `CLU` model that can identify online order actions (e.g. checking the status of an order).
Now, both of these DSATs are resolved, and Contoso Outdoors still maintains their existing `RAG` chat functionality, as `UnifiedConversationOrchestrator` falls back to the original `RAG` chat if `CLU`/`CQA` are not fit to respond to the user chat.

This displays the "better together" story when using Azure AI Language and Azure OpenAI.

**Note:** GenAI is used in the following contexts:
- demo code: general AOAI GPT chat client to break user inputs into separate utterances.
- demo code: general AOAI GPT `RAG` client to provide grounded responses as a fallback function.
- orchestrator: one routing option uses AOAI GPT function-calling to decide whether to call `CLU` or `CQA` runtimes.

**Note:** This project includes sample data to create project dependencies. Sample data is in the context of a fictionary outdoor product company: Contoso Outdoors.

**Note:** Routing strategies:
- `BYPASS`: No routing. Only call fallback function.
- `CLU`: Route to `CLU` runtime only.
- `CQA`: Route to `CQA` runtime only.
- `ORCHESTRATION`: Route to either `CQA` or `CLU` runtime using an Azure AI Language [Orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/overview) project to decide. 
- `FUNCTION_CALLING`: Route to either `CLU` or `CQA` runtime using AOAI GPT function-calling to decide.

In any case, the fallback function is called if routing "failed". `CLU` route is considered "failed" is confidence threshold is not met or no intent is recognized. `CQA` route is considered "failed" if confidence threhsold is not met or no answer is found. `ORCHESTRATION` and `FUNCTION_CALLING` routes depend on the return value of the runtime they call.
